Shipment Tracking

Project Overview
This project analyzes the journey of shipments for a logistics company. The focus is on transforming shipment tracking data to understand delivery performance and end-to-end journeys through a courier network. The solution flattens nested JSON data, computes important metrics, handles logistics edge cases, and produces CSV reports for further analysis.

How to Use This Project
To use or reproduce this project, clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shipment-tracking-analysis.git


Tools and Environment
Databricks

Language: Python,Pyspark

File Format: JSON (input) â†’ CSV (output)

Directory Structure:
- data/ (input, JSON format)
- outputs/ (processed shipment details and summary, CSV format)

Data Source and Setup
Step 1: Download the Data
Obtain the shipment tracking dataset from the assignment resource or instructor-supplied link.

Step 2: Prepare Data Directory
Place the JSON dataset file inside the data/ directory in your project root.

Step 3: Launch Your Jupyter Notebook or Python Script
Open the supplied notebook or script in your Python environment.


Project Workflow (Assignment Parts)
Part 1: Load and Explore Data
Load the shipment tracking JSON file into a pandas DataFrame.

Explore schema, row counts, examples, and nested fields.

Part 2: Flatten and Extract Shipment Data
Extract shipment-level fields: tracking number, payment type, shipment weight, pickup/drop address, and status events.

Flatten nested arrays and parse important event timestamps.

Part 3: Compute Shipment Performance Metrics
Compute human-readable IST datetimes (pickup, delivery).

Calculate days taken for delivery (pickup to delivery in days).

Count number of delivery attempts (unique 'Out for Delivery' events).

Part 4: Handle Edge Cases
Properly handle shipments with missing or duplicate events, same-day delivery, and missing values.

Part 5: Output Flattened Shipment CSV
Output: outputs/shipments_flattened.csv

Each row: one shipment, with all computed fields (tracking number, pickup/delivery datetimes, days taken, payment type, pincodes, delivery attempts, etc).

Part 6: Output Delivery Statistics Summary CSV
Output: outputs/shipment_summary.csv

Contains: mean, median, and mode for days taken for delivery and delivery attempt counts.

Final Deliverables
Python notebook or script with code, comments, and explanations
shipments_flattened.csv: per-shipment records

shipment_summary.csv: delivery performance summary
